<p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/"> Code First Girls </a>. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

<p> 1.HTML is cool</p>
<p> 2.CSS is cooler</p>
<p> 3.JS is the best</p>

<h3>What do you need to create a website?<h3>
  <p> Not much! </p>

<ul>
  <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
  <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
  <li>A web browser (I am using chrome) Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
</ul>
